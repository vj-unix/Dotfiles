# Screentide 🌊

A highly customizable, responsive, and minimalist screentime tracking widget for the **KDE Plasma 6** Desktop Environment, powered by the local, open-source **[ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/)** engine.

Screentide lets you visualize your daily computer usage total, hourly activity charts, and top applications at a glance, directly from your desktop or panel.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Responsive Layout Reflow**:
    *   **Dual Mode Layout**: Smoothly transitions between a vertical **Portrait** layout and a side-by-side **Landscape** layout on resize.
    *   **Adaptive App Grid**: Top applications automatically reflow between **1-column** and **2-column** layouts depending on widget width to prevent layout squishing.
    *   **Fluid Typography**: Header text and label sizes automatically scale down on compact widget sizes to avoid text clipping.
*   **System Theme Matching & Color Engine**:
    *   **System Accent Colors**: Automatically match your system theme accent colors (such as wallpaper-based accent schemes) with programmatic gradients, or bypass gradients entirely with **Solid Color** mode.
    *   **Manual Palette Picker**: Customize colors (Background, Border, Bar Gradients, Hover States) visually using the native KDE system color dialog or hex input fields.
*   **Dynamic Hour Grouping**:
    *   Group hourly usage bars into **1-hour, 2-hour, 3-hour, 4-hour, or 6-hour** intervals. It is perfect for shrinking widget sizes down to fewer bars without losing details.
    *   Bar widths scale dynamically to zero-overlap, ensuring visual clarity even on narrow screens.
*   **Application Blacklisting**:
    *   A comma-separated exclusion filter to hide background processes, system lock screens, or desktop launchers (e.g. `krunner, lockscreen, plasmashell`) from your stats.
*   **Robust Offline Recovery**:
    *   If `aw-server` is stopped or unreachable, Screentide displays a clean warning screen with an instant **Retry** button so you can re-connect as soon as the service is back online.
